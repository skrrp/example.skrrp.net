# example.skrrp.net

A simple template to generate HTML sites with Apache2's server-side include engine.

Note this is NOT a static site generator, there are plenty of those elsewhere.

## Assets

### SVG 

The icons for changing theme are included in the bundle and are free to use.

### Fonts 

The fonts included in the `font` directory are included under the Open Font License (read it here: https://openfontlicense.org/ )

You may use them, or replace them as you wish. They were both downloaded from https://fontesk.com/ , a great resource for free fonts. Make sure you use the web versions.

### Skrrp logo and favicon

These are included as examples. The images are Copyright skrrp.net 2023 as original works. You are likely to want to change them to reflect your own branding. Make sure to also include the `logo-dark.png` file if you are using the theme switcher.
