<p>This website is an example of the template engine that runs on Apache2 and separates the concerns of layout, content and navigation. Other than the font files bundled with the example it is available under an MIT license and you can find the source code at <a href="https://github.com/skrrp/example.skrrp.net">https://github.com/skrrp/example.skrrp.net</a>.</p>
<h1>example.skrrp.net</h1>
<p>A simple template to generate HTML sites with Apache2's server-side include engine.</p>
<p>Note this is NOT a static site generator, there are plenty of those elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Assets</h2>
<h3>SVG</h3>
<p>The icons for changing theme are included in the MIT license and are free to use.</p>
<h3>Fonts</h3>
<p>The fonts included in the <span class="mono grey-box">font</span> directory are included under the Open Font License (read it here: <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/">https://openfontlicense.org/</a>)</p>
<p>You may use them, or replace them as you wish. They were both downloaded from <a href="https://fontesk.com/">https://fontesk.com/</a>, a great resource for free fonts. Make sure you use the web versions.</p>

<p>A note on fonts - when testing the site with JavaScript disabled in Firefox (as you should) - I noticed that the custom fonts don't load at all even though they are pure CSS. I do not know if this is a bug or intended behaviour, but you should also test with JavaScript enabled to see the font you are using.</p>
<h3>Skrrp logo and favicon</h3>
<p>These are included as examples. The images are Copyright skrrp.net 2023 as original works. You are likely to want to change them to reflect your own branding. Make sure to also include the <span class="mono grey-box">logo-dark.png</span> file if you are using the theme switcher.</p>
<h3>A note on external resources</h3>
<p>You need to gain consent for any external resources that are loaded. The biggest culprit is Google fonts, but this applies to anything - including Font Awesome. It is always better if you host each resource you need on your own server and do not make external calls. Making external calls is illegal without consent in some jurisdictions.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>In order to use this template you need an Apache2 server with the following modules enabled:</p>
<pre class="mono grey-box">
    sudo a2enmod include
    sudo a2enmod rewrite
</pre>
<p>Then restart your server:</p>
<pre class="mono grey-box">
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
</pre>
<p>A sample site config looks like:</p>
<pre class="mono grey-box">
    &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
        ServerName example.skrrp.net
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/example.skrrp.net/
        &lt;Directory /var/www/example.skrrp.net/&gt;
                Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride All
                Require all granted
        &lt;/Directory&gt;
        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
        &lt;Directory "/"&gt;
                Options -Indexes
        &lt;/Directory&gt;
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =example.skrrp.net
        RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
<p>Securing the site with SSL is left as an exercise to the reader. It is best to use Let's Encrypt - <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">https://letsencrypt.org/</a>.</p>
<p>You should then clone the repo into a directory on your server and alter the config above to reflect where it is placed. Then enable the site with:</p>
<pre class="mono grey-box">
    a2ensite 000-example.skrrp.net.conf
</pre>
<p>then reload your configuration:</p>
<pre class="mono grey-box">
    service apache2 reload
</pre>
<p>If you get any errors on the reload you should investigate and fix. Good luck.</p>
<p>You should then replace the <span class="mono grey-box">img/site.ico</span>, <span class="mono grey-box">img/logo.png</span> and <span class="mono grey-box">img/logo-dark.png</span> files with your own branding. At this point, the example site should be running.</p>
<h2>How to use this template</h2>
<p>The template tries its best to separate concerns - style, navigation and content. It's not a full CMS even if you squint and it still requires manual effort to get it to hang together but it's simple and easy to create fast loading sites with simple HTML.</p>
<h3>Style</h3>
<p>Style is probably the easiest. The <span class="mono grey-box">site.css</span> file is loaded first and should contain all of your static style elements.</p>
<p>Anything that is related to theme needs to be clumsily added into the array in <span class="mono grey-box">js/css-picker.js</span>. I have not built a full theming engine sorry. While I have settled on 4 basic themes - a mix of hi- and low- contrast in light and dark - there is in theory no limit to how many you may have. Simply add to the <span class="mono grey-box">js</span> file to create new ones and make buttons for them.</p>
<p>Since the CSS is loaded first and the JavaScript applied afterwards you may put elements in both. In fact, it is best for the CSS to work for the entire site with JavaScript disabled.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>Content is also easy. Each content page is a simple HTML page. You should put everything that goes inside a <span class="mono grey-box">body</span> tag in the file - that is start with a heading and end at the end of the content. Any and all HTML elements are available.</p>
<p>You can organise content as you wish, but I find it easier to create separate sub-directories in my site for each subject area and then an additional content directory in each. The base content directory in the example layout contains content to do with the site rather than subject matter - eg: the main index and the about page.</p>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>This is the tricky one and is still a bit clunky.</p>
<p>I am aware that it is possible to read from the URL and dynamically load content. I have chosen not to go this route as it allows fishing expiditions and directory traversal attacks simply by modifying the URL. This means that each and every content page needs a layout page to mirror it.</p>
<p>This is the site's main <span class="mono grey-box">index.html</span>:</p>
<pre class="mono grey-box">
    &lt;!--#set var="title" value="example.skrrp.net" --&gt;
    &lt;!--#set var="head" value="head.html" --&gt;
    &lt;!--#set var="menu" value="menu.html" --&gt;
    &lt;!--#set var="content" value="/content/index.html" --&gt;
    &lt;!--#include file="template.html" --&gt;
</pre>
<p>These files are all very similar and are a pain to create, but they make the site work.</p>
<p>The first line sets the title of the page - the words that appear in the browser's title bar or on the tab.</p>
<p>The next defines the header file to use. This is likely to be the same each and every time, but it allows for swapping out of header files to include extra functionality on certain pages. </p>
<p>The next defines the menu to use. Since this is the base <span class="mono grey-box">index.html</span> it uses the base menu. Pages within the subject areas of your site will probably use different menu files.</p>
<p>The next tells the page which content to load. This is an absolute path to the content file.</p>
<p>The final line tells the server to load the base template file and kick it all off.</p>
