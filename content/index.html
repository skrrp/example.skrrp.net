<p>This website is an example of the template engine that runs on Apache2 and separates the concerns of layout, content and navigation. Other than the font files bundled with the example it is available under an MIT license and you can find the source code at <a href="https://github.com/skrrp/example.skrrp.net">https://github.com/skrrp/example.skrrp.net</a>.</p>

<p>A simple template to generate HTML sites with Apache2's server-side include engine.</p>
<p>Note this is NOT a static site generator, there are plenty of those elsewhere.</p>

<p>A note on fonts - when testing the site with JavaScript disabled in Firefox (as you should) - I noticed that the custom fonts don't load at all even though they are pure CSS. I do not know if this is a bug or intended behaviour, but you should also test with JavaScript enabled to see the font you are using.</p>
