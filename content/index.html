<p>This website is an example of the template engine that runs on Apache2 and separates the concerns of layout, content and navigation. Other than the font files bundled with the example it is available under an MIT license and you can find the source code at <a href="https://github.com/skrrp/example.skrrp.net">https://github.com/skrrp/example.skrrp.net</a>.</p>
<h1>example.skrrp.net</h1>
<p>A simple template to generate HTML sites with Apache2's server-side include engine.</p>
<p>Note this is NOT a static site generator, there are plenty of those elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Assets</h2>
<h3>SVG</h3>
<p>The icons for changing theme are included in the MIT license and are free to use.</p>
<h3>Fonts</h3>
<p>The fonts included in the <span class="mono grey-box">font</span> directory are included under the Open Font License (read it here: <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/">https://openfontlicense.org/</a>)</p>
<p>You may use them, or replace them as you wish. They were both downloaded from <a href="https://fontesk.com/">https://fontesk.com/</a>, a great resource for free fonts. Make sure you use the web versions.</p>

<p>A note on fonts - when testing the site with JavaScript disabled in Firefox (as you should) - I noticed that the custom fonts don't load at all even though they are pure CSS. I do not know if this is a bug or intended behaviour, but you should also test with JavaScript enabled to see the font you are using.</p>
<h3>Skrrp logo and favicon</h3>
<p>These are included as examples. The images are Copyright skrrp.net 2023 as original works. You are likely to want to change them to reflect your own branding. Make sure to also include the <span class="mono grey-box">logo-dark.png</span> file if you are using the theme switcher.</p>
<h3>A note on external resources</h3>
<p>You need to gain consent for any external resources that are loaded. The biggest culprit is Google fonts, but this applies to anything - including Font Awesome. It is always better if you host each resource you need on your own server and do not make external calls. Making external calls is illegal without consent in some jurisdictions.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>In order to use this template you need an Apache2 server with the following modules enabled:</p>
<pre class="mono grey-box">
    sudo a2enmod include
    sudo a2enmod rewrite</pre>
<p>Then restart your server:</p>
